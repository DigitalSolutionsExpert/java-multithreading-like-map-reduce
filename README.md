<H1>Java Multithreading Like Map Reduce API</H1>

I started this project intending to create an API to work with various multithreading techniques in Java.
The idea is to create a map reduce like API but using threads.

Disclaimer : this project is not finished yet, it is only a first version.
Future Work :
 - eliminate working directly with Object, create implementations
 - create the ability to use fork/join implementation
 - create the ability to use ExecutorService
 - create the ability to use multi threading reducers
 - better understand the map reduce phase and the user of master
 - adding emit() functions
 - adding shuffle functions
 - use a better approach to asbtract workers, maybe bridge
